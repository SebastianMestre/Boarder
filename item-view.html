		<h1>Typecheck `match` expressions</h1>
		<p><small>tags: type-system</small></p>
		<pre>There are two important parts related to typechecking a match expression: checking
that it uses the fields that exist on the type of the matched value, and typechecking
the result of the match expression

It seems sensible to only do the first part only once the type of the matched-on
value is known. But, since the second part may depend on the result of the first
one, we end up with a whole bunch of order-dependance in the typechecker, which I
would rather not deal with...

UPDATE: I have thought about this a good deal, and I think I found a solution.

Here it goes:


==== What is the problem we are trying to solve? ====

When we typecheck a match expression, we learn some things about the type of
the thing we are matching on. We do not learn its type, but we do learn some
facts that can be helful in further type chcking/deduction

Example:

x := fn (y) {
  return match (y) {
    a => 5;
    b => b;
  };
}

The match expression has fields "a" and "b", thus, we know that y must be of
union type with fields "a" and "b", but we do not know its actual type.

Also, we know that (since all branches of a match must have the same type),
the field `b` is of type `int`.

==== What tools will we use? ====

First, I introduce the idea of a dummy-union. This is a form of typefunc whose
only purpose is to help in unification.

A dummy-union has a list of all the identifiers that are known to be in a union
typefunc, along with their deduced monotype. It esentially represents a typefunc
which is known to be a union with (at least) certain fields, but whose identity
is not yet known.

When we unify two dummy-unions, we merge their information.

example:

unify_typefunc(
  dummy-union{ {{ "a", mono_int() },
                { "b", mono_string() },
                { "c", new_var() }} },
  dummy-union{ {{ "c", mono_int() }} });

gives as a result:

dummy-union{ {{ "a", mono_int() },
              { "b", mono_string() },
              { "c", mono_int() }} };

When we unify a dummy-union with an union, we check that the dummy-union is
compatible with the union (i.e. that it doesn't have any extra fields, and that
the types of the fields can be unified)

example:

unify_typefunc(
  dummy-union{ {{ "a", mono_int() },
                { "b", mono_string() }} },
  union{ {{ "a", mono_int() },
         { "b", mono_string() },
         { "c", mono_int() }} });

gives as a result the original union:

union{ {{ "a", mono_int() },
        { "b", mono_string() },
        { "c", mono_int() }} };

==== How can this be used to typecheck match? ====

When we typecheck a match expression, we create a new dummy-union typefunc with
all the fields that were matched on.
We then unify this with the typefunc of the value we are matching on.

Going back to the example from before

x := fn (y) {
  return match (y) {
    a => 5;
    b => b;
  };
}

we can do a step by step of this program being typechecked:

typecheck x:
| typecheck fn (y) { ... }:
| | y : new_var()
| | return_type : new_var()
| |
| | typecheck return:
| | | typecheck match(y) { a; b; }:
| | | |   let du = new_dummy_union { {{ "a", new_var() },
| | | |                               { "b", new_var() }} }
| | | |   unify(typeof y, new_term(du, {}))
| | | |
| | | |   let x = newvar
| | | |   unify(x, typeof 5)   // we get int
| | | |   unify(x, typeof b)   // we learn that the field "b" of du has type int
| | | |   match(y) { ... } : x // the match returns an int
| | |
| | | unify(current_function().return_type, typeof match (y) { ... }) // we get int
|
| x : generalize(typeof fn (y) { ... }) // we get x : ( du(<>) ) -> int


At the end of typechecking, we can go over all the ast, and check whether anything
still has a dummy typefunc in its type. In which case, we can tell that we were
not able to do complete deduction, and we can emit an error.

manipulated by the runtime from getting freeâ€™d prematurely.

A possible way to do this is with a std::shared_pointer-esque RAII type: keep a
handle-refcount on every object, and have the GC automatically visit it if its
refcount is not 0. (do bookkeeping using an unordered_set)</pre>
